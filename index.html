                    I am currently an Product Development Engineer at Treace Medical Concepts. I develop the procedures surgical technique and accompanying implants and instrumentation for bunion correction surgery.
                    I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Mechanical Design from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in 2019 and am currently pursing an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a focus in Mechanical Design at WPI. I have a strong passion for mechanical engineering.

            I have worked on many projects throughout my professional career. These projects have ranged from improving an existing design to creating a whole procedure including implants and instrumentation from initial concept. I have worked on both electro-mechanical and standard mechanical designs.  I have lead cross-functional teams through all the phases of a product launch including the FDA submission process.
